Paper summary of "Learning to Generate Chairs With Convolutional Neural Networks"  <2017-01-29 Sun>

* A subset of data from [[http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/seeing3Dchairs/][Seeing 3D Chairs Datset]] used for training, segmentation masks generated by subtracting white background

* Input is a 1 HOT encoding of class of chair, Viewpoint as cosine and sine angle (azimuth and elevation), Transormation parameters (scaling, rotation, stretch, saturation, brightness and color).

* Output is a 2D view of the chair along with it's segmentation mask
* Can interpolate between chairs fairly well easily
