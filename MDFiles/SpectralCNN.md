## Spectral Convolutional Neural Networks
- [Spectral Representations for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5649-spectral-representations-for-convolutional-neural-networks): Paper introduces the usage of FFT to achieve speed-up over traditional CNN. Very impressive results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
