## Binary Neural Networks
- [Binarized Neural Networks: Training Deep Neural Networks with Weights and Activations Constrained to +1 or -1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830): Bengio's hallmark binary neural net paper.

- [BMXNet: An Open-Source Binary Neural Network Implementation Based on MXNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09864):  Good implementation of binary nets on Amazon's MXNet framework.

- [XNOR-Net: ImageNet Classification Using Binary Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05279): Simple binary network based on XNOR operations for classification tasks.

- [Towards Accurate Binary Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11294): DJI's paper on binary neural nets for accurate results (as accurate as real counterparts). [<img src="../README/images/logo/document.png" width="24" height="24" />](../PaperSummaries/BNN/ABCNetSummary.pdf) 

- [Local Binary Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06049): Uses LBP based filters which don't change but update the weighning between them. Pretty amazing results and should be easy to speed-up.
