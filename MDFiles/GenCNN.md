## General Neural Networks
- [Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10130): Tom Goldstein's paper on visualizing loss functions.  [<img src="../README/images/logo/pytorch.jpg" width="24" height="24" />](https://github.com/tomgoldstein/loss-landscape). 

- [An Analysis of Deep Neural Network Models for Practical Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07678): A paper with amazing plots of comparison of different architectures for accuracy, size, memory, speed and power. Can take inspiration for plots in future papers comparing architectures.

- [Inverse Compositional Spatial Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03897): Better STN inspired by Inverse Compositional Lukas Kanade Tracker (IC-LK). Seems very promising.

- [SlowFast Networks for Video Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03982): Presents a method of having two pathways (one slow and one fast) for the same task. Might be useful for short and long term planning.
