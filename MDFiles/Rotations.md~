## Rotations, Special Orthogonal Group and Quaternions

- [Quaternion kinematics for the error-state Kalman filter](http://www.iri.upc.edu/people/jsola/JoanSola/objectes/notes/kinematics.pdf): Useful for IMU Models and formulation of Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF). Some amazing slides on [ESKF can be found on MEAM620's website](https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~meam620/wiki/index.php?n=Main.Schedule2016?action=download&upname=2016_22-error_state_kalman_filter_new.pdf).
